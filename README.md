# Anti-Forensics-VHDX

This is a simple VHDX file with some files that have been named according to what was done with them. For text and Word files, make sure you read the contents of the file so you see what I did to them and can attribute that activity to MFTECmd output that's included. 

Also, as a hint, some files have been deleted through various means. The filenames will give away what was done to those files.
